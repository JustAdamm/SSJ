This is the SSJ script I made for Panda's World Bunny Hop but as an addon format so I can release it.
People have been asking me over and over again to use it on their server or LAN...
so I thought I may as well just put it out there. 

Just simply place into your /addons file.

You can edit the SSJ colour in the file lua/autorun/ssj.lua with the "SSJ_Col" variable, 
format: SSJ_Col = Color( R, G, B ) 
(see: www.colorpicker.com)

Note: This ONLY works on GRAVIOUS's version of Bunny Hop!
